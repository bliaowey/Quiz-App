I built this quiz app in my free time following a Youtube tutorial made by GreatStack:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8&ab_channel=GreatStack
I made several changes to the template quiz app built by GreatStack:
1. I made the app Boston Bruins themed since they are my favorite hockey team. I changed the colors on the background, question, and answer button hover to reflect the Black and Gold identity of the team
2. I also made the questions related to Bruins trivia
3. I added in functionality for an Image and Caption to pop up explaining the correct answer to the question. This was not in GreatStack's video.
